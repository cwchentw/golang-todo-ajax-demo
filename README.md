# TODO List in Web Form

This repo demos the usage of web forms with a simple TODO list app.

## System Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for SQLite

For Windows users, install GCC provided by [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).

## Usage

### Install its Dependencies

Run *install.sh* (for Unix) or *install.bat* (for Windows) to install the dependencies for the repo.

### Build It

Run *build.sh* (for Unix) or *build.bat* (for Windows) to build the app.

### Run It

The app stores its data into an in-memory SQLite database. Therefore, no persistent data will be generated after the app ends.
